##Problem Definition

Human Trafficking <=> Slavery

Today we'll be focusing on Sex Trafficking.

Sex trafficking happens a few ways:

1. A person is kidnapped and forced into sex slavery 
2. A person is mentally/physcially violated to such an extreme place, they submit to the will of the trafficker

A possible solution to 1 - Match missing persons pictures with pictures from sex marketplace websites such as backpage

Solving 2 is harder.  To understand how to stop problem 2, we must understand the approach a trafficker uses to break his victims:

1. The trafficker cuts off the victims social connections and emotional support center, refocusing this system souly on them ~ 3-7 months

2. Once the victim has no other or a very small social/emotional support center, the trafficker begins to physically beat the victim or rape them ~ once per month

3. Then the victim is moved into a small living quarters with other victims and made to compete for the traffickers attention and affection by making the trafficker money.  

4. The trafficker reinforces a pattern of control with a combination of violence, rape, and occasionally consential sex. ~ beats or rapes them once per month.  Trafficker says the victim will be beat or raped nearly constantly.  At this point the victim is trapped. 

Presently law enforcement attacks the problem by intervening when the victim is in stage 4.  Sometimes we are able to intervene sooner, but usually we are not.  

What we need is a system that understands the __contributing__ __factors__ that led to that person becoming a victim in the first place and understand the "basket" of policy choices they can employ to limit the amount of trafficking and to hit reasonable goals to reduce human trafficking supply.

The system I am building addresses this question - how do we build analyses that will aid the in combatting human trafficking, not just when a person has become a victim, but how do we stop them from becoming a victim?

##The system

In the current state the system performs automated investigations into human trafficking.  

So how does law enforcement decide what might be human trafficking?

Primarily it looks at cases involving violence and prostitution.

Web Scraping an ad -> Running an investigation

My goal for this system is to get it into every police department in the country, so they can automatically run human trafficking investigations and gather evidence as fast as possible.  And so that they can come up with leads for future cases, by comparing against current cases.
